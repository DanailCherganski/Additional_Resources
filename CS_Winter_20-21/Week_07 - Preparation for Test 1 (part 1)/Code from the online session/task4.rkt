- What is the name of the procedure? graph-contains-points
- How many arguments does it take? Label them. xss f
- What is the domain of the attributes? all
- What is the simplest case?
- What is an extreme case?
- What case would return an error? no
- Can we write down the steps to solve it?

Is there an element?
  no -> #t
  yes -> take the first coordinate. Supply to the lambda. second coord == result from lambda?
                                     yes -> continue with cdr xss
                                     no -> return #f
