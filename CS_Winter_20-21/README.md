# Functional Programming, Computer Science, Winter Semester 2020-2021 

# Algorithm for solving exercises
    - What is the name of the procedure/function?
    - How many arguments does it take? Label them.
    - What is the domain of the attributes?
    - What is the simplest case?
    - What is an extreme case?
    - What case would return an error?
    - Can we write down the steps to solve it?

    1. What is the name of the procedure/function?
    2. How many parameters does it take?
    3. What is the type of the parameters?
    4. What are the names of the parameters?
    5. What is the return type?
    6. How would you solve it on a sheet of paper?

    1. Какво е името на процедурата/функцията?
    2. Колко параметъра приема?
    3. Какъв е типът на параметрите?
    4. Какви са имената на параметрите?
    5. Какво трябва да се върне?
    6. Как бихте решили задачата, ако нямахте компютър, а само лист и химикал?

# In case of a wrong result in Racket
    - check procedure application => should be prefix
    - procedure <=> parenthasis
    - reconstruct the algorithm
