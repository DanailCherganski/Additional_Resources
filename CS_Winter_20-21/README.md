# Algorithm for solving Racket exercises:
    - What is the name of the function?
    - How many arguments does it take?
    - Construct an algorithm (steps or diagram) that solves for the test cases.
    - Try the simplest case.
    - Try the most extreme case.

# In case of a wrong result:
    - check procedure application -> should be prefix.
    - parenthasis around every procedure.
    - reconstruct the algorithm.
