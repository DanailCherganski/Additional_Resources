# Functional Programming, Computer Science, Winter Semester 2020-2021 

# Algorithm for solving exercises
    - What is the name of the procedure/function?
    - How many arguments does it take? Label them.
    - What is the domain of the attributes?
    - What is the simplest case?
    - What is an extreme case?
    - What case would return an error?
    - Can we write down the steps to solve it?

# In case of a wrong result in Racket
    - check procedure application => should be prefix
    - procedure <=> parenthasis
    - reconstruct the algorithm
