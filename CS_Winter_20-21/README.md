# Algorithm for solving Racket exercises:
    - What is the name of the procedure?
    - How many arguments does it take? Label them.
    - Make a list of all the constraints. (What is the domain of the attributes?)
    - Construct an algorithm (steps or diagram) that solves for the test cases with the given constraints.
    - Try the simplest case.
    - Try the most extreme case.
    - Try a case that should returns an error.

# In case of a wrong result:
    - check procedure application -> should be prefix.
    - parenthasis around every procedure.
    - reconstruct the algorithm.
