# Tasks

# Task 1
Write a function that removes symbols other than numbers and digits in a string.

Test cases:

    countLettersAndDigits "n!!ice;!123" -> 7
    countLettersAndDigits "wh@t is th1s" -> 9

# Task 2
Ifã€€a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 ... z = 26 then

l + o + v + e = 54 and

f + r + i + e + n + d + s + h + i + p = 108.

Write a function that scores a non-empty string.

# Task 3
Define a function that takes two numbers "n" and "k" and returns a vector (x, y) where x is the first five-digit number and y - the last five-digit number not greater than n that satisfy the following properties:

 - evenly divided by k;
 - the first digit is in the interval [2, 5];
 - the second digit is in the interval [3, 6];
 - the third digit is in the interval [4, 7];
 - the fourth digit is in the interval [5, 8];
 - the fifth digit is in the interval [6, 9];
 
Test cases:

    specialFives 99999 12 -> (23556,56688)
    specialFives 30000 11 -> (24486,26686)
    specialFives 99999 17 -> (23477,56678)

# Task 4
Write a function that takes a list of strings and returns each line prepended by the correct number.

The numbering starts at 1. The format is "n: string". Notice the colon and space in between.

Examples:

    number [] -> []
    number ["a", "b", "c"] -> ["1: a", "2: b", "3: c"]

# Task 5
A self-dividing number is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains. For example, 128 is a self-dividing number because 128 % 1 = 0, 128 % 2 = 0, and 128 % 8 = 0. Given a lower and upper number bound, output a list of every possible self dividing number, including the bounds if possible.

Example:

    selfDividing 1 22 -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22]

Note:

    A self-dividing number is not allowed to contain the digit zero.

# Task 6
Convert a string to a new string where each character is "(" if that character appears only once in the original string, or ")" if it appears more than once. Ignore capitalization.

Examples:

    convert "din" -> "((("
    convert "recede" -> "()()()"
    convert "Success" -> ")())())"
    convert "(( @" -> "))((" 

# Task 7
By using the following types define a function that accepts a list of records and returns the hardest subject.

type Student = String<br>
type Subject = String<br>
type Note = Double<br>
type Record = (Student, Subject, Note)

Test case:

    hardestSubject [("John", "Maths", 5), ("Kennedy", "English", 2), ("Joe", "Programming", 4), ("Claudia", "Programming", 6), ("Sam", "Maths", 4), ("Jenn", "English", 2)] -> "English"
