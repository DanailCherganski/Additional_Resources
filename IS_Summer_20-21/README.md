# Algorithm for solving Haskell exercises

    1. Study Haskell syntax
        a. Lectures
        b. Cards
        c. Solving GitHub (there are many exercises too complex for the time we have, so I post them there)
    2. Read the task.
        a. What is the name of the function?
        b. How many arguments does it take?
        c. What data types are the input arguments?
        d. What data type is the output argument?
    3. Solve it with a diagram.
        a. Why is the example right?
        b. What are the steps to go through?
        c. Do all examples work with that diagram?
    4. Transform the diagram into code.
