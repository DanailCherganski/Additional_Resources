# Tasks

# ( ! ! ) Task 1 ( ! ! )
Define a function that accepts a graph, a whole number "k" and a node "n". Return all the paths starting from "n" that are "k" nodes long. Create types to represent the nodes, graph and path. Don't forget to validate the node!

Test cases:

    simplePaths [(1, [2, 3]), (2, [3, 4]), (3, []), (4, [])] 0 1 -> [[1]]
    simplePaths [(1, [2, 3]), (2, [3, 4]), (3, []), (4, [])] 1 1 -> [[1, 2], [1, 3]]
    simplePaths [(1, [2, 3]), (2, [3, 4]), (3, []), (4, [])] 2 1 -> [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 4]]
    simplePaths [(1, [2, 3]), (2, [3, 4]), (3, []), (4, [])] 1 2 -> [[2,3],[2,4]]

Note:

    Path ::= acyclic connection between nodes ending with a node that has no outgoing connections.

# Task 2
Let (x, y, z) be a vector representing the nodes of a binary tree such that x is the value of the current node, y and z are the values of the child nodes. Define a function that returns the leaves of such a tree.

Test cases:
    
    listLeaves [(1, 2, 3), (2, 4, 5)] -> [4, 3, 5]
    listLeaves [(2, 4, 5), (1, 2, 3)] -> [4, 5, 3]
    listLeaves [(1, 2, 3), (3, 4, 5), (5, 6, 9)] -> [2, 4, 6, 9]

# Task 3
Define a new data type called "Shape". Shape must have four constructors:
 - Circle: with one argument representing the radius;
 - Rectangle: with two arguments representing the width and height;
 - Triangle;
 - Cylinder with two arguments for the radius of the base and height.

Create a shape from every type and output it.

# Task 4
Define a function that accepts two functions: "f" and "g" and a list of points with two coordinates. The function should return those points for which f(firstCoordinate) = g(secondCoordinate) and should be able to work with whole as well as floating point numbers!

Test case:

    myImages (\x -> x * x) (\x -> x + 2) [Point 2 2, Point 1 2, Point 3 7] -> [Point 2 2, Point 3 7]

# Task 5
By using the "Shape" data type, define the following functions:

    perimeter;
    area;
    isRound - returns whether a shape has a round side;
    is2D - returns whether a shape has two dimensions.

Test cases:

    perimeter $ Circle 5 -> 31.42
    perimeter $ Rectangle 2.5 4.5 -> 14
    perimeter $ Rectangle 5.5 20.6 -> 52.2
    perimeter $ Triangle 5.3 3.9 4.89 -> 14.09
    perimeter $ Cylinder 2.5 10 -> 30   

    area $ Circle 5 -> 78.54
    area $ Rectangle 2.5 4.5 -> 11.25
    area $ Rectangle 5.5 20.6 -> 113.3
    area $ Triangle 5.3 3.9 4.89 -> 9.128
    area $ Cylinder 20 30 -> 6283.19   

    isRound $ Circle 5 -> True
    isRound $ Rectangle 2.5 4.5 -> False
    isRound $ Rectangle 5.5 20.6 -> False
    isRound $ Triangle 5.3 3.9 4.89 -> False
    isRound $ Cylinder 20 30 -> True

    is2D $ Circle 5 -> True
    is2D $ Rectangle 2.5 4.5 -> True
    is2D $ Rectangle 5.5 20.6 -> True
    is2D $ Triangle 5.3 3.9 4.89 -> True
    is2D $ Cylinder 20 30 -> False

Note:

    Perimeter of a cylinder: 4*r + 2*h
    Area of a cylinder: 2*pi*r*h + 2*pi*r*r.

# Task 6
By using the "Shape" data type, define two functions that accept a list of shapes and:

    1. The first returns their areas;
    2. The second returns the shapes with the biggest areas.

Test cases:

    getAreas [Circle 5, Rectangle 2.5 4.5, Rectangle 5.5 20.6, Triangle 5.3 3.9 4.89, Cylinder 20 30] -> [78.54, 11.25, 113.3, 9.128, 6283.19]
    maxArea [Circle 5, Rectangle 2.5 4.5, Rectangle 5.5 20.6, Triangle 5.3 3.9 4.89, Cylinder 20 30] -> [Cylinder 20.0 30.0]
    
# Task 7
Define a new data type called "Point". A point may have two or three dimensions. Create an instance of every type and print it.

## By using the "Point" data type, complete the tasks below.

# Task 8
Define a function that finds the distance between two points. Make sure the points have equal dimensions!

Test cases:

    distance (TwoD 2 5) (TwoD 6 9) -> 5.66
    distance (ThreeD 2 5 10) (ThreeD 6 9 (-5)) -> 16.0

# Task 9
Define a function that accepts a point "p" and a list of points. The function returns the points from the list that are closest to "p".

Test case:

    closestTo (ThreeD 2 5 10) [(ThreeD 4 5 6), (ThreeD 5 2 (-10)), (ThreeD (-2) 1 45), (ThreeD 12 0 2), (ThreeD 6 5 4)] -> [ThreeD 4.0 5.0 6.0]

# ( ! ! ) Task 10 ( ! ! )
Define a function that accepts a list of points and returns a vector (Double, Point, Point) that represents the closest distance between any two points, and the points themselves.

Test case:

    getClosestDistance [(ThreeD 4 5 6), (ThreeD 2 5 10), (ThreeD 5 2 (-10)), (ThreeD (-2) 1 45), (ThreeD 12 0 2), (ThreeD 6 5 4)] -> (2.8284271247461903,ThreeD 4.0 5.0 6.0,ThreeD 6.0 5.0 4.0)
